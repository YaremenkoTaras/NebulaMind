## [Unreleased]

### Added - 2025-10-26 (Arbitrage System Improvements)
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** for failed arbitrage chains
  * Automatic blacklisting after 3 consecutive failures
  * 5-minute timeout before retry
  * Prevents repeated execution of problematic chains
- **Adaptive Slippage Protection**
  * Configurable slippage tolerance (default 1.0%)
  * Only executes chains with profit > (minProfit + slippageTolerance)
  * Reduces losses from market slippage
- **Smart Order Sizing**
  * Maximum 20% of budget per trade
  * Smaller amounts for new/untested chains
  * Larger amounts for proven profitable chains
- **Chain Success Tracking**
  * Real-time statistics per chain pattern
  * Success rate, average slippage tracking
  * Informs smart sizing decisions
- **Emergency Stop Conditions**
  * Auto-stop when total loss > 5% of budget
  * Auto-stop when net profit < -2%
  * Auto-stop after 5 consecutive losses
  * Protects against large drawdowns
- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
  * Automatic retry for 5xx server errors
  * Max 2 attempts with 1 second delay
  * Better handling of temporary failures
- **Enhanced Task Tracking**
  * Consecutive wins/losses counter
  * Maximum drawdown tracking
  * Stopped reason for emergency stops
- **Advanced Task Parameters**: slippageTolerance, maxLossPerTrade, enableCircuitBreaker, enableSmartSizing
- **Detailed specification document**: spec/arbitrage-improvements.md

### Changed - 2025-10-26 (Arbitrage System Improvements)
- **ArbitrageTaskExecutor** completely rewritten with intelligent filtering and risk management
- **Task entity** enhanced with runtime tracking fields (consecutiveLosses, consecutiveWins, maxDrawdown, stoppedReason)
- **Frontend TaskStatistics** enhanced with 4-column dashboard including Streak/Drawdown widget
- **Improved logging** with detailed execution metrics (expected vs actual profit, slippage calculations)

### Fixed - 2025-10-26 (Arbitrage System Improvements)
- High failure rate (39% â†’ expected 10-15% with improvements)
- Excessive slippage losses (1-2% per trade)
- Lack of protection against repeated failures
- No risk management for capital allocation
