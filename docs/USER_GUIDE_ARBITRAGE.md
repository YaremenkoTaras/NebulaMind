## What is Triangular Arbitrage?

Triangular arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits price differences across three different currencies or assets in a circular trading path.

### Example:
Imagine you have **100 USDT**:

1. **Buy BTC** with USDT ‚Üí You get 0.002 BTC (@ 50,000 USDT/BTC)
2. **Buy ETH** with BTC ‚Üí You get 0.05 ETH (@ 0.04 BTC/ETH)  
3. **Sell ETH** for USDT ‚Üí You get 101.25 USDT (@ 2,025 USDT/ETH)

**Result:** You started with 100 USDT and ended with 101.25 USDT = **+1.25 USDT profit (+1.25%)**

This profit comes from temporary price inefficiencies in the market.

## Understanding Parameters

### Base Asset
- **What it is**: The currency you start and end with
- **Requirements**: Must be a currency you actually have in your account
- **Examples**: USDT, BTC, ETH, BNB
- **Tip**: USDT is most common as a base asset

### Max Assets to Analyze
- **What it is**: Number of currencies to include in the analysis
- **Range**: 3 - 50
- **Trade-off**: 
  - **Lower (5-10)**: Faster scan, fewer opportunities
  - **Higher (20-50)**: Slower scan, more opportunities
- **Recommended**: Start with 10-20

### Chain Length
- **What it is**: Number of trades in the arbitrage chain
- **Minimum**: 3 (for triangular arbitrage)
- **Maximum**: 5 (for more complex paths)
- **Trade-off**:
  - **Length 3**: Simpler, fewer opportunities, lower profit

## Risk Management

### Understanding Risks

1. **Market Risk**
   - Prices can change between scan and execution
   - High volatility increases risk
   - "Actual profit may differ from expected"

2. **Execution Risk**
   - One trade might fail mid-chain
   - You could be left holding an unwanted asset
   - Order might not fill completely

3. **Fee Risk**
   - Trading fees eat into profit
   - Slippage on large orders
   - Minimum profit should cover fees

4. **Liquidity Risk**
   - Low liquidity = high slippage
   - Large orders move the price
   - Check market depth before large trades

### Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- **Always check Minimum Required Amount** before execution
- Start with small amounts (10-100 USDT) but above minimum
- Target profits ‚â• 1% for safety margin
- Execute chains with recent timestamps (<1 minute old)
- Use liquid major assets (BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT)
- Monitor your first few executions closely
- Read error messages carefully (they tell you exactly what's needed)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Don't trade during extreme volatility
- Don't use your entire balance
- Don't chase tiny profits (<0.5%)
- Don't execute old opportunities (>2 min)
- Don't ignore the risk warnings
- **Don't try to execute with less than minimum required amount**
  - Error: "Please use at least X USDT (currently using Y USDT)"
  - Solution: Increase your amount or choose different chain

### Position Sizing

**Conservative:**
- Use 1-5% of your total portfolio per trade
- Example: $1,000 portfolio ‚Üí max $50 per trade

**Moderate:**
- Use 5-10% of portfolio
- Example: $1,000 portfolio ‚Üí max $100 per trade

**Aggressive:**
- Use 10-20% of portfolio  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only for experienced traders

## Troubleshooting

### "No profitable chains found"

**Possible causes:**
- Min profit % is too high ‚Üí Try lowering it
- Max assets is too low ‚Üí Try increasing to 20-30
- Market is efficient (no arbitrage) ‚Üí Try different base asset
- Wrong base asset ‚Üí Try USDT instead

**Solutions:**
```
1. Lower minProfitPercent to 0.3%
2. Increase maxAssets to 30
3. Try different base asset (USDT, BTC)
4. Wait for market volatility
```

### "Execution failed"

**Common reasons:**
- Insufficient balance
- Rate changed (chain no longer profitable)
- Exchange connectivity issue
- Order size below minimum

**What to do:**
1. Check error message for details
2. Verify your balance
3. Try scanning again for fresh opportunities
4. Check exchange status

### "Base amount must be positive"

**Cause:** You entered 0 or negative amount

**Solution:** Enter a positive number ‚â• minimum required amount

### "Insufficient amount" / "Invalid quantity"

**Error example:**
```
Insufficient amount for BTCUSDT: quantity 0.00020017 is below minimum 0.001.
Please use at least 50 USDT (currently using 10 USDT)
```

**Cause:** The amount you entered is too small for the exchange's minimum quantity limits

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Min Required Amount** in the execution dialog (shows before you enter amount)
2. **Increase your amount** to at least the minimum shown
3. **Choose different chain** if the minimum is too high for your budget
4. **UI Protection**: The input field shows the minimum and validates your entry

**Why this happens:**
- Each trading pair has minimum order sizes (e.g., 0.001 BTC)
- Your base amount gets converted through multiple steps
- If any step falls below its minimum, execution fails
- System now calculates and shows you the required minimum upfront

### API Connection Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to load assets"
- "Scan request failed"
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart all services** (easiest):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/tyaremenko/work/NebulaMind
   ./cicd/local/restart-local.sh
   ```

2. Check backend services are running:
   ```bash
   # Check trading-core
   curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
   
   # Check agent-builder  
   curl http://localhost:8082/api/agent/health
   ```

3. View logs for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/trading-core.log
   tail -f /tmp/agent-builder.log
   ```

2. Verify `.env.local` has correct URL:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_BUILDER_URL=http://localhost:8082
   ```

3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

## FAQ

### Q: How often should I scan?

**A:** Every 1-5 minutes during active trading hours. Market conditions change constantly.

### Q: What's a good profit percentage?

**A:** For 3-step chains:
- **0.5-1%**: Acceptable, covers fees
- **1-2%**: Good opportunity
- **>2%**: Excellent, but verify it's real!

### Q: Can I lose money?

**A:** Yes, if:
- Prices move against you during execution
- Fees exceed profit
- One trade fails mid-chain

Always start small to test.

### Q: How long do opportunities last?

**A:** Usually 10-60 seconds. Execute quickly or they disappear.

### Q: Should I use LLM asset selection?

**A:** Optional feature:
- **Pros**: AI selects most promising assets
- **Cons**: Requires OpenAI API key, slower scan
- **Recommendation**: Manual selection works fine for start

### Q: What's the minimum amount to start?

**A:** 10-20 USDT is safe for testing. Exchange minimums vary (typically 5-10 USDT).

### Q: Can I run multiple chains simultaneously?

**A:** Not recommended - you might not have enough balance for all, and it increases risk.

### Q: How do I maximize profit?

**A:**
1. Scan frequently (every 2-3 minutes)
2. Execute quickly (within 30 seconds of scan)
3. Use liquid assets (BTC, ETH, BNB)
4. Increase max assets (20-30)
5. Monitor during high volatility periods

### Q: Is this profitable in real trading?

**A:** It can be, but:
- Competition is high (bots are faster)
- Fees reduce profit significantly
- Real slippage differs from estimates
- **Start in sandbox mode first!**
